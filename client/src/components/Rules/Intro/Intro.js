                Baccarat, also known as punto banco, is one of the oldest and most
                popular games in casinos all over the world. It is especially
                popular among high-rollers and Asian gamblers. In Macau, baccarat is
                extremely dominant. Although the game seems serious and elegant, it
                is really as simple as betting on the flip of a coin.
